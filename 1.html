				Do scoring -- can be done on the basis of km traveled ie pixels here.. or no of icebergs passed by the ship.. former is easier
				Make collision proper.. if you can come up with a triangle mechanism to check for iceberg collision
				Add boundary collision.. make set interval function in ship ant call interval every 100 miliseconds
				also write start screen . and game over screen.

o	Expected year of graduation:2015

How did you hear about this program?
From a friend.

We advise all students applying for coding projects to apply for Google Summer of Code as well. Are you planning to apply for Google Summer of Code and, if so, with what organization(s)?

Yes, I have applied to GSOC with the NMAP organization.


Please describe your experience with the organization's product as a user and as a contributor (include the information, as well as a link or an attachment, for the required contribution you made to the project you are interested in here):

I have used VLC for windows as well as Ubuntu.
On Windows,
•	I have used VLC as a you-tube downloader
•	I have recorded from webcam
•	I have used extensions like subtitler.
•	As a c
As a contributor, I have not worked with VLC as of now. I will however contribute by fixing a bug or adding a feature soon.


Please describe your experience with any other FOSS projects as a user and as a contributor:

I am a user of Linux OS. However, I have not contributed to FOSS before now.


Please describe any relevant projects that you have worked on previously and what knowledge you gained from working on them (include links):

•	I have worked closely with the C language for the past 5 years. One of the projects I have worked with is the implementation of a make file. This uses parsers and data structures. Link: https://github.com/rashrag/MakeFile
•	One of my projects was object recognition and tracking for cloud scale surveillance. For this we used the open TLD project, which is written in C++ and Matlab. Here I was exposed to the concepts of C language again as we built the code from scrath.
•	My other languages of comfort are Java and Python. Web languages I am familiar with are HTML, PHP and JavaScript. Some of my projects can be found at my git handle: rashrag




What project(s) are you interested in?

Chrome OS' NaCl support for VLC's core

Who is a possible mentor for the project you are most interested in?

Felix Kühne

Please describe the details and the timeline of the work you plan to accomplish on the project you are most interested in (discuss these first with the mentor of the project):

The project is mainly concerned with porting VLC into Chrome native client. The modules that do not directly compile are disabled and enabled separately one by one. The major task is to write an audio and video output.
The last part of the project is an HTML front end.

For the first month, my plan is to first get the compiling modules running on the native client. I would then proceed to take up individual non working modules. At the same time I would work on writing an audio output module. I would take inspiration from “pepper audio API” written for Chrome NaCl.

For the second month, I plan to add more modules to the NaCl and work on the video output module. As of now, I have not found any working video output API’s to base the design on. However, I will continue to search for them or else will help design my own.

For the third month, I would get almost all remaining modules running. As I have sufficient knowledge in web development, I do not think front end development will take up too much time. However, a callback to the VLC backend may take up more time. 

I have sufficiently good knowledge in C and C++, which are the core languages of NaCl. I have sufficiently good JavaScript and HTML knowledge that will help me understand the architecture. If I get into the program, I will before the start of the program be well versed with the native client architecture, so that I can spend the given time working on the porting aspect itself.


Will you have any other time commitments, such as school work, another job, planned vacation, etc., between May 19 and August 18, 2014?

As of now I have no other commitments for this summer. My term end on May 24th, 2014 and I am free for the remainder of the summer.
I have also applied to NMAP organization for Google Summer of Code. If I do get in, I still have around 45 hours a week to give to this project as I have no other plans for this summer!

Conclusion:
This is my first attempt of entering into the open source world. This project has interested me and I believe I will have fun working on it.
I am an enthusiastic and quick learner, which will definitely be a plus point for the organization.
